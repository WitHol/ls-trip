Overview of the source files:
- main.rs - the main source file, it is meant to be simple and act like a high-level overview
- shared.rs - a file containing different functions that are needed, but are too general to enclose them in specific source files
- trips/ - a module containg the different drug trip types. All of them have one public function, named main(), that creates a drug trip with a drug trip of a certain type
